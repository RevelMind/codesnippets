## Express Example
Creates a simple web server with Express.  Once you run `node snippets/javascript/express_example` it will start the server at `localhost:80`.  You don't need to include the port as 80 is the default port for HTTP.  It uses a catchall to route all pages and always sends the response:
```
Hello, world!
```
### DEPENDENCIES
- Express (`npm i express`)
